<h3 id="sectionheader">Attention and Framing Effects</h3>

<div id="teachtext">
	<p>What causes the framing effect? One explanation, based in 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">dual-system models</span> 
		of behavior, is that fast emotional responses (System 1) to perceived 
		gains or losses pull us in opposite directions unless we're able to 
		reassert our rationality by engaging in slower, deliberative thinking 
		(System 2). A way to test this prediction is to have people make 
		decisions under strict time limits - and, in line with the 
		dual-system account, framing effects get larger
	(e.g., <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616689092">
		Guo et al., 2017</a>)! The idea here is that time pressure cuts 
		off the process before System 2 can correct System 1:</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/dual_system.jpeg" alt="Dual-system and time pressure"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>
		
	<p>But what if time pressure is truncating a different sort of process? We hypothesized 
		time pressure might cut visual information search short and that this can end up 
		looking a lot like what's predicted by some (though not all) dual-system models. 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">That is, 
		instead of interrupting shifts between modes of thought, time pressure is interrupting 
		shifts in attention:</span>
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/attention_model.jpeg" alt="Attention and time pressure"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>This is exactly what we've found. Recording people's eye movements while they 
		complete the same task as in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616689092">
			Guo et al., 2017</a>, we found that under time pressure:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>People often chose without looking at both options</li>
				<li>People were unlikely to choose something they hadn't looked at</li>
				<li>People's early attention was biased in a way that mirrored the effects 
					of time pressure on choice</li>
			</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/psci_fig2.png" alt="Roberts et al. (in press) - Figure 2"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>This work is in press at <span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;"><em>Psychological Science</em></span>.</p>

	<p>Next, we wanted to try some formal tests to see just how much attentional patterns can 
		account for framing effects both with and without time pressure. To do this, we compared 
		<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-15704-003"> Diederich & Trueblood's (2018)</a> 
		elegant dual-system model of framing effects with an adapted version of a gaze-informed 
		attentional drift diffusion model 
		(<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2635">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>;
		<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17326-x">Teoh et al., 2020</a>). 
	</p>

	<p>Both of these models depict choice as a gradual accumulation of noisy evidence 
		until a threshold is met. In the dual-system model, the evidence that's accumulated 
		at first is shaped by prospect theory parameters (System 1) until it later switches 
		to accumulating evidence that is determined by expected value (System 2). Meanwhile, 
		in the gaze-informed model, attention to an option amplifies the influence of its value
		in the evidence accumulation process. Critically, take a look at how evidence accumulation 
		early on in the process compares:
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/model_comparison.jpg" alt="Dual-system vs gaze-informed"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>The <span style="color: red;font-weight:bold;">red</span> segment of the evidence accumulation 
		process represents System 1 in the dual-system model and time when only one option has been attended in 
		the gaze-informed model. Note the similar effect they can have on preference early 
		on in the choice process.</p>

	<p>Comparing model fits, we found that 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">the gaze-informed model does a better job than 
		the dual-system model at explaining most people's choices and RTs</span>. Furthermore, using the 
		parameters from the dual-system model, we found 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">people with stronger early attention biases 
		tended to spend more time in System 1 before switching to System 2</span>. This provides further 
		support to the idea that dual-system models might sometimes be picking up on attentional dynamics.</p>
