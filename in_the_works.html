<h3 id="sectionheader">Attention and Framing Effects</h3>

<div id="teachtext">
	<p>What causes the framing effect? One explanation, based in 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">dual-system models</span> 
		of behavior, is that fast emotional responses (System 1) to perceived 
		gains or losses pull us in opposite directions unless we're able to 
		reassert our rationality by engaging in slower, deliberative thinking 
		(System 2). A way to test this prediction is to have people make 
		decisions under strict time limits - and, in line with the 
		dual-system account, framing effects get larger
	(e.g., <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616689092">
		Guo et al., 2017</a>)! The idea here is that time pressure cuts 
		off the process before System 2 can correct System 1:</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/dual_system.jpeg" alt="Dual-system and time pressure"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>
		
	<p>But what if time pressure is truncating a different sort of process? We hypothesized 
		time pressure might cut visual information search short and that this can end up 
		looking a lot like what's predicted by some (though not all) dual-system models. 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">That is, 
		instead of interrupting shifts between modes of thought, time pressure is interrupting 
		shifts in attention:</span>
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/attention_model.jpeg" alt="Attention and time pressure"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>This is exactly what we've found. Recording people's eye movements while they 
		complete the same task as in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616689092">
			Guo et al., 2017</a>, we found that under time pressure:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>People often chose without looking at both options</li>
				<li>People were unlikely to choose something they hadn't looked at</li>
				<li>People's early attention was biased in a way that mirrored the effects 
					of time pressure on choice</li>
			</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/psci_fig2.png" alt="Roberts et al. (in press) - Figure 2"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>The above plot on the right shows the very first fixation to an option. This raises the 
		question, how do people know where to look first? We thought they might be able to use 
		their peripheral vision to detect the colors of the pie charts that were used to display 
		the option probabilities. This predicts that fixation should be influenced by gamble 
		probability, even though people haven't looked at the gamble yet. And that's what we found:</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/psci_fig3.png" alt="Roberts et al. (in press) - Figure 3"
			style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>This work is in press at <span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;"><em>Psychological Science</em></span>.</p>

	<p>Next, we wanted to try some formal tests to see just how much attentional patterns can 
		account for framing effects both with and without time pressure. To do this, we compared 
		<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-15704-003"> Diederich & Trueblood's (2018)</a> 
		elegant dual-system model of framing effects with an adapted version of a gaze-informed 
		attentional drift diffusion model 
		(<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2635">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>;
		<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17326-x">Teoh et al., 2020</a>). 
	</p>

	<p>Both of these models depict choice as a gradual accumulation of noisy evidence 
		until a threshold is met. In the dual-system model, the evidence that's accumulated 
		at first is shaped by prospect theory parameters (System 1) until it later switches 
		to accumulating evidence that is determined by expected value (System 2). Meanwhile, 
		in the gaze-informed model, attention to an option amplifies the influence of its value
		in the evidence accumulation process. Critically, take a look at how evidence accumulation 
		early on in the process compares:
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/model_comparison.jpg" alt="Dual-system vs gaze-informed"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>The <span style="color: red;font-weight:bold;">red</span> segment of the evidence accumulation 
		process represents System 1 in the dual-system model and time when only one option has been attended in 
		the gaze-informed model. Note the similar effect System 1 and early attention can have on evidence early 
		on in the choice process.</p>

	<p>Comparing model fits, we found that 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">the gaze-informed model does a better job than 
		the dual-system model at explaining most people's choices and RTs</span>. Furthermore, using the 
		parameters from the dual-system model, we found 
		<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">people with stronger early attention biases 
		tended to spend more time in System 1 before switching to System 2</span>. This provides further 
		support to the idea that dual-system models might sometimes be picking up on attentional dynamics.
		A preprint of this work will be available soon.</p>
	
	<p>But how much does early attention really matter? To test this, we've run a few experiments where
		we simply remove the different pie chart colors that people had used as peripheral cues. When we do this,
		the overall effect of time pressure on framing effects goes away. In fact, the framing effect is now 
		<em>smaller</em> under time pressure!
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/ph_riskyChoice_feedbackOnly.png" alt="Manipulating peripheral cues"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>Preprint of this work is also coming soon.</p>

	<p>We think these results clearly show that visual attention is critical for the producing the framing 
		effect <span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">in this particular task</span>. Furthermore,
		our <span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">gaze-informed model</span> shows that attentional
		patterns can account for the framing effects observed under no time pressure as well!</p>
		
	<p>But none of these results answer the question: 
	<span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">What's driving attention?</span></p>

	<p>To explain attention, I've been working on a new computational model that I call 
		the <span style="color: #59C317;font-weight:bold;">attention-guided 
		Bayesian-learning model of framing effects</span>. In a nutshell, the idea 
		is that at each moment when making a decision our participants can opt for one of the following:

		<ol type="1">
			<li>Terminate information search and choose the option they currently think is best</li>
			<li>Gather more information about the options</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>Gathering information means refining their beliefs about each option's attributes. For the gamble, 
		participants can learn about its outcomes and its probability:
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/gamble_priors.png" alt="Gamble priors"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the sure option has attributes for the seen and unseen framings 
		(we assume they know the probability of 1.0 with confidence):
	</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/sureOption_priors.png" alt="Sure option priors"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>

	<p>How do they update these beliefs? According to the model, by drawing
		noisy perceptual samples while looking at the visual information. They 
	incorporate these samples to update their beliefs in a Bayesian sense:</p>

	<p><img src="images/in_the_works/lossFrame_updatePrior.png" alt="Loss belief updating"
		style="width:700px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;"></p>
	
	<p>Importantly, if you want to learn, you should inspect the thing you're the most unsure about. 
	And that's on way attention works in our model. A decision-maker's attention is drawn 
	to the option she knows the least about. Additionally, attention can be drawn by beliefs about value.</p>

	<p>My model has another feature worth mentioning: people use mental conversions 
		to sample the unseen framing of the sure option.</p>
	
	<p>We're working out final details in this model but so far it's 
		succeeding in accounting for both attention and choice in the framing 
		effects task. Stay tuned!</p>
